This environment simplifies programming by orders of magnitude compared to the traditional blocky-based system. Additionally, the way Pybricks uses the DriveBase object makes your robot more reliable.

# Pybricks framework

Pybricks
: Pybricks is Python and Block coding for smart LEGO® hubs. Run programs directly on the hub, and get full control of your motors and sensors.  
For further details, documentation, programming environment and sample projects head to [their website](https://pybricks.com).

We are grateful to the developers of PyBricks and recommend that you try this framework out in the next season.

Pybricks has made these capabilities also available in a block-based environment that is not completely free but requires a recurring or one-time [payment](https://pybricks.com/learn/intro/access). I have purchased the license because we have gained so much from this framework and simply wanted to experiment and pay back.

{: .highlight }
I recommend that if you can, you also support the further development of Pybricks.
